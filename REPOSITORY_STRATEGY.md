# 📁 **REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION STRATEGY**

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC SEPARATION: WHAT BUYERS SEE vs. PRIVATE SALES MATERIALS**

### ✅ **WHAT GOES IN PUBLIC REPOSITORY (Buyers Will See):**

```
📁 catalyst-roi-calculator/ (MAIN REPOSITORY)
├── 📁 src/ - Complete React application source code
├── 📁 dist/ - Production-ready build files  
├── 📁 public/ - Static assets and HTML
├── 📄 package.json - Dependencies and scripts
├── 📄 README.md - Professional application overview
├── 📄 TECHNICAL_SPEC.md - Technical documentation
├── 📄 DEPLOYMENT.md - Hosting instructions
└── 📄 Various test files - Quality assurance demos
```

### 🔒 **WHAT STAYS PRIVATE (Local Only):**

```
📁 private-sales-strategy/ (NEVER PUSH TO REPOSITORY)
├── 📄 SALES_DECK.md - Pricing strategy & acquisition terms
├── 📄 OUTREACH_TEMPLATES.md - Your competitive email templates
└── 📄 Internal strategy documents
```

```
📁 workspace-root/ (DEPLOYMENT GUIDES - OPTIONAL)
├── 📄 DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Buyer-friendly hosting guide
├── 📄 QUICK_DEPLOY.md - 5-minute deployment instructions  
└── 📄 deploy-checklist.md - Implementation roadmap
```
